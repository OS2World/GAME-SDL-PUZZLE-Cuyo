README for cuyo:


For the impatient
=================

To install cuyo, follow the instructions in the INSTALL file. Or follow
this ultra-short installation guide:
1.   ./configure (in the same directory as this file)
2.   make
3.   make install

To play cuyo without really installing it (perhaps because you are not root)
(you can leave out steps 3 and 4 if you don't care about native language
support):
1.   ./configure --datadir=`pwd`/data --localedir=`pwd`/locale
2.   ln -s . data/cuyo
3.   Create the path <this-directory>/locale/<your-locale>/LC_MESSAGES
4.   ln -s ../../../po/<your-locale>.gmo <this-directory>/locale/<your-locale>/LC_MESSAGES/cuyo.mo
5.   make
6.   src/cuyo
If you do this, you should NOT do a make install later!


If ./configure did not work or if you intend to modify cuyo, then read
README.maintainer instead.
